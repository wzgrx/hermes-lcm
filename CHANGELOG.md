# Changelog

This repo also publishes GitHub Releases. This file is the repo-root release surface for operators who want the recent release arc without leaving the checkout.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Build the synthetic PEM redaction fixture at runtime so Hermes plugin security scanning no longer reports an embedded private key.
- Align `plugin.yaml` with the actual registration contract: declare the three hooks and leave LCM tool discovery to the context-engine schema path rather than `PluginContext.register_tool`.

## v1.0.0-rc.1 - 2026-09-03

### Highlights

- Harden untrusted prompt, externalized-payload, dependency, and SQLite file
  boundaries while keeping optional assertion, query-view, pre-answer evidence,
  embedding, and adaptive-retrieval paths disabled by default (#557).
- Preserve active-runtime slash-command routing and durable cumulative
  compaction telemetry across session rollover, restart, concurrent updates,
  and response-hook persistence (#526).
- Make concurrent startup safer by serializing deep FTS bootstrap repair and by
  reconciling legitimate transient SQLite rollback-journal disappearance
  without relaxing stable symlink, hardlink, or path-swap rejection (#570,
  `c368323`).

### Changed

- #526 binds slash commands to the active runtime and makes cumulative
  compaction counts durable across restart and session rollover.
- #557 adds exact 900,000-token caps for the three proven bare Codex routes on
  `openai-codex`, publishes the host-owned dependency assurance contract, and
  hardens prompt, payload, storage, backup, and sidecar boundaries.
- #570 serializes constructor-time FTS repair, rechecks the complete FTS state
  after acquiring ownership, and preserves caller-owned transaction behavior.
- `c368323` tolerates only verified transient rollback-journal disappearance or
  unlink windows during SQLite artifact restriction. It also replaces a
  scheduler-sensitive Voyage timing assertion with deterministic bounded-return
  and exactly-once-dispatch synchronization; production provider behavior is
  unchanged.

### Upgrade and rollback notes

- This is a prerelease candidate, not the stable v1.0.0 release. The tag-driven
  workflow marks it as a prerelease and does not make it the latest release.
- Before updating, use `/lcm backup` while Hermes is live, or stop every SQLite
  writer and copy `lcm.db`, `lcm.db-wal`, and `lcm.db-shm` together as one
  quiescent snapshot. Update the plugin, restart Hermes, send one normal
  message, then verify `plugin_version: 1.0.0-rc.1` and the expected database
  path with `lcm_status`.
- The core schema remains version 5. No manual migration or embedding backfill
  is required, and a stock/default-off upgrade creates no optional feature
  tables. Restore the pre-upgrade snapshot before downgrading if an optional
  store was enabled after the update.

## v0.21.0-rc2 - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- #492 corrects the optional `tiktoken` trajectory-state chunking path to
  preserve UTF-8 character boundaries while keeping each decoded chunk within
  its token budget. If the budget cannot contain one complete Unicode
  character, the path fails explicitly instead of emitting replacement
  characters.

## v0.21.0-rc1 - 2026-08-03

### Highlights

- Add the trajectory/experience-memory subsystem and the opt-in assertion,
  evidence, query-view, and adaptive-retrieval surfaces delivered by the
  consolidated wave-1 merge (#436).
- Keep the core SQLite schema at version 5. New feature stores use additive,
  named migrations in the same profile database, while disabled/default-off
  installs do not create optional assertion, query-view, or embedding tables.
- Improve large-store and startup behavior with bounded vector/metadata work,
  lock-contention retry during WAL conversion, and deferred temporal-rollup
  maintenance (#361, #440, #446, #447).

### Changed

- #436 adds the consolidated trajectory/experience-memory, retrieval,
  exact-evidence, citable-delivery, privacy, scale, and release-validation wave.
  Its committed benchmark results are directional evidence for the documented
  harness and corpus, not universal provider or workload guarantees.
- #361 retries WAL conversion when connection setup meets lock contention.
- #440 moves temporal-rollup maintenance off the session-start critical path;
  bounded background work is eventual and `lcm_recent` retains its fallback.
- #446 and #447 batch large fixture setup for embedding/vector metadata release
  coverage without changing runtime behavior.

### Upgrade notes

- Back up `lcm.db`, update the plugin checkout, restart Hermes, send one normal
  message, then verify `plugin_version: 0.21.0-rc1` and the expected database
  path with `lcm_status`. The core schema remains version 5.
- No manual core migration or embedding backfill is required from v0.20.0.
- Query/evidence tool schemas are exposed after upgrade, but assertion
  extraction, assertion storage, query-view storage, pre-answer evidence, and
  adaptive retrieval remain opt-in. Review provider/privacy boundaries before
  enabling model- or embedding-backed paths.

## v0.20.0 - 2026-07-23

Release focus: Lossless-Claw parity plus the merged cross-session recall and temporal retrieval stack.

- Completed the five selected Lossless-Claw parity behaviors: recoverable active-replay stubs for large externalized tool results; token-bounded fresh tails that preserve the newest message and complete tool-call/result groups; dry-run-first historical tool-output backfill with guarded rollback; bounded active-session externalized-payload search with strict ownership and recoverability checks; and bounded atomic threshold full sweeps with one final active-context publication. (#380, #381, #382, #413)
- Shipped the merged #413 recall and temporal surface: `lcm_recall`, `lcm_recent`, and `lcm_load_session`; semantic and hybrid retrieval over summaries and message chunks; temporal rollups with bounded fallback; optional proactive recall; and the corresponding benchmark and reproduction documentation.
- Release boundary: stock installs keep large-output externalization, active-replay stubbing, embeddings, temporal rollups, proactive recall, and threshold full sweeps disabled by default. Payload search requires explicit `content_scope`; historical backfill remains an operator-invoked, dry-run-first command. Committed benchmark results are directional evidence under their documented model and harness, not a universal provider-parity claim. This release does not include the later work tracked in #423, #434, or #436.

## v0.19.0 - 2026-07-07

Release focus: data-safety hardening, operator diagnostics, import tooling, benchmarking, and the WS5 engine decomposition.

- Hardened lossless storage and replay boundaries: GC tombstones preserve surrounding text, ingest failures surface in status/doctor, ignored-message drops are counted, persisted Hermes tool outputs and redacted durable retries replay losslessly, and auxiliary bypass/session fallback edge cases are covered. (#298, #308, #310, #312, #313)
- Strengthened storage and downgrade safety with serialized lifecycle/DAG writes, monotonic frontiers, path-contained externalized payloads, ReDoS-safe redaction, wrapped-base64 handling, a summary spend guard, and a schema-too-new open guard. (#300, #301, #302)
- Added operator and migration surfaces: read-only `lcm_inspect`, JSONL session export import, compression no-op status, compaction telemetry, benchmark-backed preset validation, and steady-state hot-path benchmarks. (#295, #303, #306, #307, #309, #320)
- Added CI-backed ruff linting and release/validation-friendly tooling updates, including follow-up JSONL import hardening and metadata JSON access through `MessageStore`. (#314, #315, #316)
- Began and documented the behaviour-preserving WS5 decomposition of the ~9k-line `engine.py`: stateful method clusters became `*Mixin` classes (`compaction.py`, `reconcile.py`, `aux_session.py`, `placeholder_ledger.py`) mixed back into `LCMEngine`, and pure/helper groups became plain modules (`engine_registry.py`, `codex_routing.py`, `sqlite_util.py`, `runtime_identity.py`, `message_analysis.py`). (#323, #324, #325, #326, #327, #328, #329, #330, #331, #332, #333, #334, #335, #336, #337, #338, #339)

## v0.18.1 - 2026-06-30

Release focus: compaction privacy, clone/hook integrity, doctor signal accuracy, and model-context safety.

- Excluded ignored backlog and stripped injected context before compaction, preventing ignored or synthetic context from entering LCM summaries. (#283, #282)
- Preserved Discord lane metadata, active LCM clone resolution, and context metadata through cloned engines and post hooks. (#292, #293, #289)
- Hardened runtime identity, raw tool call integrity refs, payload integrity checks, and doctor path/lifecycle diagnostics. (#281, #278, #279, #291, #273, #280)
- Updated Codex OAuth effective context window safety defaults. (#274, #276)
- Completed focus-topic demotion behavior and preserved raw session ownership across compression rollover. (#268, #269)
- Refreshed operator docs, community-health files, and release-validation guidance. (#272)

## v0.18.0 - 2026-06-18

- Fixed per-turn ingest for WebUI sessions and batch timestamp deduplication. (#260)

## v0.17.0 - 2026-06-14

Release focus: automatic focus-topic derivation and lifecycle hygiene.

- Added auto-derived focus topics during compression.
- Added empty lifecycle-row garbage collection to prevent unbounded accumulation. (#256)

## v0.16.x - 2026-06

Release focus: engine isolation, WAL durability, database-path clarity, and startup cost control.

- Isolated LCM engine state per agent. (#247)
- Preferred bound sessions on sibling chains when the host has zero DAG.
- Tuned compaction defaults and clarified context-threshold ownership. (#245)
- Clarified `LCM_DATABASE_PATH` override behavior. (#249)
