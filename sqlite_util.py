    ``PRAGMA busy_timeout`` alone cannot honor a short budget. Measured here
    against a held WAL writer lock, a single statement with ``busy_timeout=50``
    blocked ~850ms — 17x its own budget — deterministically. SQLite's busy
    handler sleeps in a fixed escalating pattern (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25ms...)
    and only compares total elapsed time *between* those sleeps, so when short
    sleeps cost far more than requested (they do on this platform) it sails
    past a small budget before it next looks at the clock. Whatever the precise
    cause, the empirical result is what matters: the PRAGMA does not bound a
    sub-100ms window, which defeats the point of bounding a gateway hook.

    A progress handler does not help either — measured, not assumed: it fires
    per VM instruction, and a statement parked in the busy handler runs none.

    So bound the wait in Python instead. Poll for the write lock against a real
    wall-clock deadline with ``busy_timeout=0`` (each probe fails instantly).
    Once the lock looks free, install ``timeout_ms`` and run the caller's block
    normally.

    If the deadline passes while the lock is still held, do NOT raise from the
    context manager: enter the block with ``busy_timeout=0`` so the caller's
    own first statement fails immediately with "database is locked". That keeps
    the failure attributable to the specific operation the caller was running,
    so per-step diagnostics and recovery branches stay intact, rather than
    collapsing every lock loss into one generic error at the wrong layer.

    Residual race: the probe releases the lock before yielding, so another
    writer can take it in between. ``timeout_ms`` stays installed as a backstop
    for that window, which can still overshoot — but the common case this
    guards (a long-lived writer holding the lock) is now genuinely bounded.
    A connection already inside a transaction is left alone, since probing
    would disturb the caller's transaction.
