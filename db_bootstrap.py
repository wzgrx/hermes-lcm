    In a multi-agent deployment (gateway process + CLI sessions + sub-agents),
    every process opens its own sqlite3.Connection pointing at the same
    lcm.db file.  Hermes' canonical ``database.journal_mode`` setting selects
    WAL or DELETE mode.  The settings below improve committed-write durability
    and, when WAL is selected, WAL hygiene, but do NOT make sibling processes
    safe from an unexpected process death.  Abnormal exit still depends on
    normal SQLite recovery; application-level checkpoints only run during
    graceful shutdown (see ``MessageStore.close()`` etc.).

    Key design decisions:
    - journal_mode      : delegated to Hermes so LCM follows the same policy as
                          the host's other SQLite databases.  WAL remains the
                          default when the host helper is unavailable.
    - synchronous=FULL  : fsync both the WAL and the WAL index before every
                          write transaction commit.  WAL + FULL is the only
                          combination SQLite guarantees survives power loss
                          without data loss (NORMAL may lose the WAL index).
    - wal_autocheckpoint=500 : after 500 WAL pages (~2 MB) SQLite will try
                               an automatic passive checkpoint.  This is a
                               best-effort hint — it is silently skipped when
                               another connection holds a read transaction.
                               Under checkpoint starvation WAL can grow well
                               beyond this trigger.
    - journal_size_limit=67108864 (64 MiB) : limits the WAL file size after
                                             a successful checkpoint or reset.
                                             It does NOT force a checkpoint
                                             or cap growth while another
                                             connection holds an old WAL
